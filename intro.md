This tutorial will teach you how to use PLUMED, GROMACS and Python notebooks to implement an enhanced sampling strategy for magnesium-RNA binding dynamics.

=== Scientific context

Magnesium(II) ions found in the cell environment are known to interact with RNA molecules, modulating their folding, catalytic properties and structural dynamics. Many Mg²⁺ ions adsorb or bind to the polyanionic phosphate backbone of nucleic acids. The kinetics for binding and unbinding Mg²⁺ to a phosphate group are slow compared to the typical timescale of atomistic simulations.
